# **jmp**
A small project where I created a simple 2D, infinite-scrolling jumping game made with Unity.  
Controls: Tap to jump, Tap & Hold to jump longer.  
This project was intended for learning the Unity Engine and deploying applications to the Play Store.  
*All assets were designed and created by me*
